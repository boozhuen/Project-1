          The early years and the continuation of pre-WWII supercharged engines
          (<em>1946‚Äì1950</em>)</strong
        >
      </h2>
      <p class="years">
        Formula One was first defined in 1946 by the Commission Sportive
        Internationale (CSI) of the FIA, forerunner of FISA, as the premier
        single-seater racing category in worldwide motorsport to become
        effective in 1947. This new "International Formula" was initially known
        variously as Formula A, Formula I, or Formula 1 with the corresponding
        "Voiturette" formula being titled Formula B, Formula II, or Formula 2.
        When the 500c formula was internationally recognised as Formula 3 in
        1950 it was never titled as "Formula C" so the three International
        Formulae were then "officially" titled Formula 1, Formula 2 and Formula
        3.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the beginning, the formula was largely based on pre-World War II
        regulations defined by engine capacity. The regulation expected to bring
        a new balance between supercharged and normally aspirated cars.
        Non-supercharged 4.5-litre pre-war Grand Prix cars were allowed to race
        against the pre-war 1.5-litre supercharged 'voiturettes', while pre-war
        supercharged 3-litre Grand Prix cars were banned.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is some debate as to what can be considered to be the first
        Formula 1 race. The first race under the new regulations was the 1946
        Turin Grand Prix held on 1 September, the race being won by Achille
        Varzi in an Alfa Romeo 158 Alfetta - but this was before the Formula was
        officially in place. The next contender is the 1947 Swedish Winter Grand
        Prix which was won by Reg Parnell driving an ERA - but this race was run
        on ice and some consider that it therefore was not a "proper" race
        (there is also some doubt whether it was a Formula 1 race or a Formule
        Libre race). The third claimant is the 1947 Pau Grand Prix which was won
        by Nello Pagani driving a Maserati 4CL, which is irrefutable.
        <br />
        <br />
        Championships for drivers or constructors were not introduced
        immediately. In the early years there were around 20 races held from
        late Spring to early Autumn (Fall) in Europe, although not all of these
        were considered significant. Most competitive cars came from Italy,
        particularly Alfa Romeo. Races saw pre-war heroes like Rudolf
        Caracciola, Manfred Von Brauchitsch and Tazio Nuvolari end their
        careers, while drivers like Alberto Ascari and Juan Manuel Fangio rose
        to the front.

      <h2>
        <strong>
          The era of factory Italian and Mercedes front-engine cars
          (<em>1950‚Äì1957</em>)
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <p class="years">
        Discounting the Indianapolis 500, the World Championship was entirely
        based in Europe until 1953 when the season opened in Argentina. Since
        then, there has always been at least one race outside Europe each year.
        <br />
        <br />
        As planned, the World Championship races returned to Formula One
        regulations for the 1954 season, now based on a new 2.5-litre
        atmospheric engine regulation. This successfully brought more entrants
        to the field. Lancia and Mercedes-Benz came to the formula, hiring the
        best drivers of the era: Ascari for Lancia, Fangio for Mercedes.
        Featuring desmodromic valves, fuel injection, magnesium and exotic
        alloys parts, "streamlined" bodywork and other advanced features, the
        brand new Mercedes began the 1954 season with Fangio taking pole
        position at the "Grand Prix de l'ACF" at Reims-Gueux with the first lap
        over 200 km/h (124 mph) in Formula One before winning the race after a
        duel with other Mercedes driver Karl Kling, who finished second.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Mercedes cars swept the next two seasons with Fangio and Moss
        winning all but three of the races. However, at the end of the 1955
        season Mercedes vanished as swiftly as they had come. They had proven
        the superiority of their technology, but the crash of one of their
        sports cars that year at Le Mans, killing 83 people, was also a
        significant factor. The company would not return to Formula One for
        forty years. After Le Mans, four of the year's remaining Grands Prix
        were cancelled.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Monaco Grand Prix saw a spectacular incident when Ascari and his
        Lancia crashed into the harbour after missing a chicane. Ascari was
        pulled out of the water alive and apparently well. However, there was
        speculation over an undetected internal injury when four days later
        Ascari was killed at Monza while testing a sportscar. After Ascari's
        death, Lancia followed Mercedes out of the category, passing their
        engines, cars, information and technology to Ferrari.
        <br />
        <br />
        The 1956 season saw Fangio make good use of the Lancia-born Ferrari to
        win his fourth championship. Driving for Maserati, he took his fifth
        championship in the 1957 season, a record which would not be beaten for
        46 years.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ferrari developed a new engine for 1957, the V6 "Dino" engine, it was
        competitive by 1958 and Mike Hawthorn became the first British F1 World
        Champion, though his victory was short-lived: he died the following
        winter.
